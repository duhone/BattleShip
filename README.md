BattleShip
==========
written 1991-1993 using Turbo Pascal 6 for dos.

Battle Ship clone. Od game I wrote in my high school days. 16 bit made for dos code, 
so dosbox is required. 640x350 16 color EGA graphics.

I lost the code years ago in a hard drive crash. I did have a slightly older copy of the exe however.
This version has a few bugs unfortunatly.
